/**
 * CHALLENGE 2: Single Technician — Maximum Boxes in a Working Day
 *
 * A technician has a fixed number of working minutes today. Each box has a
 * GPS location and a repair time. Travelling between locations also burns
 * time. Your goal: choose WHICH boxes to visit and in WHAT ORDER to maximise
 * the number of boxes fixed before time runs out.
 *
 * The key insight — the closest box is NOT always the best choice:
 *   A nearby box with a long fix time can consume all remaining budget,
 *   whereas skipping it might let you fix two or three faster boxes instead.
 *   Your algorithm must weigh travel time against fix time to make the right call.
 *
 * Do NOT modify any interface or the pre-implemented helper methods.
 * Implement every method marked with TODO.
